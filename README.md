## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project challenge, I have learned that it is important have a sort of roadmap or plan before to start coding, because no project is that easy to get through it without a basic path to follow up.

### Continued development

I would like to mention the HTML Semantic Elements, I didn't know so much about this but I discover how important these elements are to accesibility and I just want to continue implementing them near future, to make sure my code and next projects are easier to understand.

### Useful resources

- [W3schoools - HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) - This helped me to understand how to use semantic elements on HTML in a better way.
- [MYBLUELINUX.COM - Gradient over image](https://www.mybluelinux.com/css-how-add-gradient-over-image/) - With this article I learned how to use gradient property over an image.
